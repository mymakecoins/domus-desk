/**
 * Workflow starter templates — the "recipe library".
 *
 * A template is a workflow definition with the install-specific bits left
 * abstract, so the same recipe can be cloned into any Domus Desk install.
 *
 * Two abstraction markers may appear anywhere an action arg or a condition
 * value would normally hold a literal:
 *
 *   ['$lookup' => 'ticket_priority', 'names' => ['P1', 'Critical']]
 *       Resolved at clone time against this install's own lookup table, by
 *       label, case-insensitively, trying each candidate name in order.
 *       Installs rename their statuses and priorities freely, so a recipe
 *       can never hardcode `status_id: 5` — it says "whatever this install
 *       calls Closed" and we look it up.
 *
 *   ['$configure' => 'Your Slack incoming-webhook URL']
 *       A value only the user can supply (a webhook URL, an email address).
 *
 * Either marker that can't be turned into a real value is cloned as an EMPTY
 * arg and reported back in `unresolved`, which the editor turns into a
 * "these fields still need you" banner. A recipe therefore always clones —
 * it just tells you honestly what it couldn't fill in.
 *
 * Cloned workflows are always INACTIVE. Nothing a recipe creates can fire
 * until the user has read it and switched it on.
 *
 * Node positions (x/y) are deliberately omitted: the canvas editor
 * auto-lays-out any workflow whose nodes lack coordinates, so recipes stay
 * readable here and still land tidy on the canvas.
