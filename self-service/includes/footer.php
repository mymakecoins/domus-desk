/**
 * Self-service portal — the shared page bottom.
 *
 * Closes the layout opened by header.php and bootstraps client-side i18n, which
 * every portal page needs and each one used to wire up itself.
 *
 * A page may set BEFORE including this:
 *   $pageScripts — a string of page-specific JS, emitted after the i18n bootstrap
 *                  so window.t() and API_BASE are already available to it.
 *   $pageData    — page-specific VALUES for that JS, as an array. Emitted as
 *                  window.PAGE, JSON-encoded.
 *   $needsRecorder — true to load assets/js/screen-recorder.js. Pair it with
 *                  `require __DIR__ . '/includes/record-modal.php';` in the
 *                  markup; the script binds to that partial's element ids.
 *
 * $pageData exists because $pageScripts is echoed as a plain STRING, and pages
 * build it with a nowdoc (<<<'JS') so that JS template literals — ${...} — are
 * not eaten by PHP interpolation. The cost of a nowdoc is that PHP tags inside
 * it are NOT executed: a `<?php echo $id; ?>` written in there reaches the
 * browser verbatim, and because the stray `<` is a syntax error at the top of
 * the block, the ENTIRE script silently fails to parse and the whole page's JS
 * dies. That happened to the ticket page. So values come through here instead
 * of being interpolated into the script text.
