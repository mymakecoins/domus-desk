<?php
/**
 * Reopening a finished ticket when the customer comes back.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SHARED
 * ------------------
 * A customer can come back through more than one door — they can reply in the
 * self-service portal, or reply to the notification email. "Reply to a finished
 * ticket" means the same thing whichever door they used, so the rule lives here
 * once and both callers use it. Two copies would drift, and the symptom would be
 * a customer whose reply reopens their ticket on Monday (email) but not on
 * Tuesday (portal), which is impossible to explain to them.
 *
 * The email template Domus Desk sends already tells requesters "just reply to this
 * email and it will be reopened" (workflow/includes/templates.php) — before this,
 * nothing anywhere honoured that promise on any channel.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS "FINISHED"
 * -------------------------
 * `ticket_statuses.is_closed` — the app's own definition of a finished ticket,
 * configurable per install in Tickets → Settings → Statuses. We deliberately do
 * NOT hardcode status names: an install that renames "Closed" to "Completed", or
 * marks "Resolved" as closed too, gets the behaviour it configured. Note the
 * shipped default flags only "Closed" and not "Resolved", so out of the box a
 * reply to a Resolved ticket appends without reopening.
 */

/**
 * Is reopen-on-customer-reply switched on? Tickets → Settings → General.
 *
 * Defaults to ON when the row is absent: the requester-facing email template has
 * always promised this behaviour, so honouring it is the answer that matches what
 * customers were already told. Reopening is non-destructive and visible (the
 * ticket comes back into the queue); the opposite failure — a customer's reply
 * silently landing on a closed ticket nobody looks at again — is not.
