/**
 * Safe extraction of an uploaded SCORM package.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * A SCORM package is a zip of static files, and it is extracted into
 * lms/content/<id>/ — a directory INSIDE the webroot, which Apache serves and
 * will happily execute PHP from. ZipArchive::extractTo() writes whatever the zip
 * contains, wherever the zip says. Left unguarded that gives anyone with the LMS
 * module three separate ways to own the server:
 *
 *   1. Ship a `.php` file in the package. It lands in a web-served directory and
 *      runs as the web server — reading config.php, the database, the AES key,
 *      every stored mailbox credential. LMS access becomes root access.
 *   2. Name an entry `../../../includes/functions.php` ("zip-slip") and overwrite
 *      any file in the app, escaping the content directory entirely.
 *   3. Ship a zip bomb — a few KB that expands to fill the disk.
 *
 * So we never hand the archive to extractTo(). Every entry is inspected first,
 * against an allowlist of things a course can legitimately be made of, and the
 * whole upload is refused if any single entry fails. Refusing the package
 * outright (rather than skipping the bad file) is deliberate: a SCORM package
 * with a shell in it is not a course with a problem, it is an attack.
 *
 * Defence in depth: lmsHardenContentDir() also drops an .htaccess that disables
 * PHP execution for the content tree, so even a future hole in the checks above
 * does not become code execution. `.htaccess` is itself on the deny list, so a
 * package cannot ship one to undo this.
