/**
 * Column drift self-check — the sibling of db_verify_index_parse.php.
 *
 * The schema has TWO hand-maintained sources of truth and they must agree:
 *
 *   database/domus-desk.sql        what a FRESH install is built from
 *   includes/db_verify_schema.php   what Database Verification ALTERs an
 *                                   EXISTING install up to
 *
 * Indexes already have a guard, but they're the easy case: the index list is
 * GENERATED from domus-desk.sql, so drift only ever means "you forgot to
 * regenerate". Columns are harder — both files are written by hand, so they can
 * disagree in either direction, and each direction breaks a different install:
 *
 *   in db_verify but NOT domus-desk.sql → a NEW install is missing the column
 *                                       until someone runs Verification
 *   in domus-desk.sql but NOT db_verify → an EXISTING install never gains it
 *
 * The first of those shipped as a real bug: `asset_locations.tenant_id` was
 * added to Verification but not to domus-desk.sql, so a fresh install fell over on
 * the asset-locations screen while every upgraded install was fine.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS IS EASY TO MISS: while developing you only ever exercise the
 * UPGRADE path. You run Database Verification, it goes green, everything works.
 * The fresh-install path is invisible to you until a stranger downloads the
 * project — and then it's the ONLY path they take. Discipline can't close that;
 * a check that runs on every Verification can.
 *
 * Mirrors capSelfCheck() and the settings-manifest self-check: the source of
 * truth is code, and the app proves the mirror matches rather than trusting a
 * human to have kept it so.
