/**
 * Collision detection — who else is in this ticket right now.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Two analysts working the same ticket without knowing it is the oldest
 * service-desk annoyance there is: both write a reply, the customer gets two
 * answers that may contradict each other, and one analyst's ten minutes are
 * gone. It happens most on a busy morning, and most of all in Unassigned, where
 * several people triage the same list at once. Nothing in Domus Desk warned you.
 *
 * PRESENCE IS A HEARTBEAT, NOT A SESSION
 * --------------------------------------
 * There is no "join" and no "leave" that has to succeed. An open ticket sends a
 * heartbeat every few seconds; a row is "live" only while `last_seen` is within
 * PRESENCE_STALE_SECONDS. So a closed tab, a killed browser, a flat battery or a
 * dropped network all resolve themselves in one stale window with nothing having
 * to run — the same reasoning that made snooze's waking need no cron (#933).
 *
 * The explicit leave (sent on navigating away) is an OPTIMISATION: it makes the
 * indicator disappear at once rather than in half a minute. Nothing depends on
 * it arriving, which is why it can ride on `sendBeacon` and be forgotten about.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT
 * --------------
 * It is not a lock. Two people may legitimately need to write on one ticket —
 * an escalation and a holding reply, say — so this warns and never blocks. A
 * lock would need an owner, a timeout, a way to steal it and a way to explain
 * why the button is greyed out, and would be wrong most of the time it fired.
 *
 * It is also not an audit trail. Rows are overwritten by the next heartbeat and
 * deleted without ceremony; "who looked at this ticket last Tuesday" is a
 * different feature with different privacy questions, and this table cannot
 * answer it.
