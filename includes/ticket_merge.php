/**
 * Merging tickets.
 *
 * WHAT A MERGE ACTUALLY IS
 * ------------------------
 * Two people reported the same printer. Or a monitoring system opened forty tickets
 * for one outage. Merging folds those conversations together so there is one place to
 * answer from — without destroying the references the requesters already hold.
 *
 * THE REFERENCE IS THE HARD PART
 * ------------------------------
 * Every notification Domus Desk has ever sent carries `[SDREF:ABC-452-98881]` in its
 * subject, and check_mailbox_email.php routes inbound replies by matching it. So a
 * merged-away ticket can never simply cease to exist: somewhere out there are emails
 * in a customer's inbox whose Reply button still points at it.
 *
 * That is why `tickets.merged_into_id` exists and why the source row is NEVER deleted.
 * The source stays, closed and flagged, and both the UI and the mail importer follow
 * the pointer. "Whatever happened to ABC?" is answerable forever, and a reply to a
 * two-year-old ABC notification still lands on the live ticket.
 *
 * TWO POLICIES, BOTH THE ADMIN'S CHOICE
 * -------------------------------------
 * Tickets → Settings → Merge behaviour, install-wide (not per-analyst: whether a
 * requester's reference survives is a promise to the CUSTOMER, and two analysts on
 * the same mailbox must not be able to disagree about it).
 *
 *   reference_mode  'survivor' — one existing ticket lives on and keeps its number.
 *                                Nothing the requester has seen becomes a dead ref.
 *                   'new'      — a brand-new ticket is minted and EVERY source folds
 *                                into it, including the one the analyst picked. All
 *                                the old refs become redirects.
 *
 *   originals_mode  'thread'      messages move onto the target, tagged with where
 *                                 they came from. Searchable, quotable, inline.
 *                   'thread_html' as above, PLUS a self-contained HTML snapshot of
 *                                 each source attached to the target.
 *                   'html'        the messages stay on their original tickets and the
 *                                 target gets only the snapshots. Tidiest target;
 *                                 the trade-off is that inbox search no longer finds
 *                                 the merged content, because search reads message
 *                                 bodies and not attachments.
 *
 * WHAT MOVES AND WHAT STAYS
 * -------------------------
 * Fourteen tables hang off a ticket, and the split is not arbitrary — the test is
 * "does this record describe the CONVERSATION, or does it describe what happened to
 * THIS TICKET?" The first kind moves; the second kind would be falsified by moving.
 *
 *   MOVE   emails (attachments follow by email_id), ticket_notes, ticket_time_entries,
 *          ticket_recordings, ticket_cmdb_objects, tasks, problem_tickets,
 *          change_tickets, form_submissions, webchat_conversations
 *
 *   STAY   ticket_audit          the source's own history. Moving it would rewrite
 *                                the past and make the source look like it never had one.
 *          sla_notifications_sent what the SLA engine did to THAT ticket, at the time.
 *          ticket_csat_responses  a survey somebody answered ABOUT that ticket.
 *          mailbox_activity_log   an append-only log; logs are not editable records.

/**
 * Undo a merge: take back exactly what was moved, and reopen the source.
 *
 * HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM UNDOING A SPLIT
 * ------------------------------------
 * Undoing a split refuses if ANYTHING has happened on the new ticket, because that
 * ticket was brand new — activity on it means somebody has started working the thing
 * you are about to delete.
 *
 * A merge is the opposite. The survivor is the LIVE ticket: people are supposed to
 * keep replying on it, and usually have. Refusing on that basis would make unmerge
 * useless within the hour. So this takes back only what the merge recorded and leaves
 * everything else on the survivor, including every reply written since.
 *
 * It still refuses when the recorded rows have been moved on AGAIN (split out, merged
 * elsewhere), because then this is no longer a reversal and pretending otherwise
 * strands messages.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT PUT BACK
 * -----------------------
 * Ticket-to-ticket LINKS that the merge re-pointed at the survivor stay there. The
 * merge did not record which links it moved (it deduplicates and drops self-links, so
 * "which ones came from the source" is genuinely ambiguous afterwards). This is a
 * known limitation rather than an oversight; the alternative is guessing, and links
 * are cheap to re-add by hand.
