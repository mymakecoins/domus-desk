/**
 * Splitting a ticket.
 *
 * A customer replies to "printer offline" with "…also my monitor flickers". That is
 * two pieces of work on one ticket: one SLA clock, one status, one assignee, and
 * whichever problem is fixed second looks late. Splitting moves the unrelated
 * messages onto a ticket of their own.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT THE MIRROR IMAGE OF MERGING
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Merging had to preserve the old reference because the customer already held it and
 * could reply to it — hence merged_into_id and the inbound-mail redirect. A split
 * creates a reference NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN. There is nothing to redirect, nothing to
 * close, and no equivalent pointer: both tickets come out of this live and
 * independent. That asymmetry is why this is a separate file rather than a flag on
 * the merge engine.
 *
 * THE MODEL, AND WHY
 * ------------------
 * Split at a chosen message, optionally taking every LATER message with it.
 *
 * There is no industry standard here — Freshdesk splits a single customer response
 * and leaves later replies behind, Zendesk ships no split at all (it is a third-party
 * app), and Jira/ServiceNow use linked or child issues instead. The recurring
 * complaint across all of them is ambiguity about whether a split COPIES or MOVES.
 * So this MOVES, and says so: the messages leave the original, and a marker is left
 * in the thread where they went, because a conversation that silently jumps from
 * Tuesday to Friday is worse than one with an explicit gap.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE THREAD IS DISPLAYED NEWEST-FIRST. "Everything after" means LATER IN TIME,
 * which is ABOVE the chosen message on screen. The UI says "newer messages" for
 * exactly this reason; keep that wording if you touch it.
