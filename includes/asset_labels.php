/**
 * QR asset labels — the tag people read, and the token machines read.
 *
 * TWO IDENTIFIERS, ON PURPOSE
 * ---------------------------
 * `asset_tag` is the number printed in human-readable text on the label
 * ("LT0001"). It belongs to the company that owns the asset, so two companies
 * on one install may each legitimately run their own LT0001 — the same reason
 * hostname uniqueness is per-company here.
 *
 * `qr_token` is what the QR code actually encodes, as a URL. It is opaque and
 * install-wide unique, which is what makes the tag collision above a non-issue:
 * whatever the label says, the scan resolves to exactly one asset.
 *
 * WHY NOT ENCODE THE ID
 * ---------------------
 * `…/a/4711` invites somebody to try 4712. The token isn't a secret — the scan
 * page requires a login and enforces company scope like every other asset read —
 * but there is no reason to hand out an enumerable index of the estate to
 * anyone who photographs one label.
 *
 * WHY THE URL IS SHORT
 * --------------------
 * `/a/<token>` rather than `/asset-management/scan.php?token=<token>`: every
 * character is another QR module, and these get printed at 15mm square on the
 * side of a laptop that then spends three years being knocked about. Fewer
 * characters is a bigger, more forgiving code.
