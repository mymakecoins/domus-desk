/**
 * API: resolve a scanned Domus Desk asset label to the asset it names.
 *
 * GET ?token=<qr_token>  ->  { success, asset|null, matches }
 *
 * The camera scanner (asset-management/scanner.php) decodes a QR into a URL of
 * the form `<base>/a/<token>`. Opening that URL is the single-asset journey;
 * this endpoint is the *continuous* one, where the scanner stays on screen and
 * only needs to know which asset was just seen.
 *
 * The response shape deliberately matches find_asset.php, because the scanner
 * calls whichever fits what it decoded — our own label, or the manufacturer's
 * serial barcode — and must not care which answered.
 *
 * SECURITY. Identical rules to scan.php, and for the same reasons:
 *   - the token is not a password, it is an unguessable name for a row, so a
 *     login and module access are still required;
 *   - an unknown token and a token belonging to a company this analyst cannot
 *     see return the SAME answer, or a label becomes an oracle for "does this
 *     asset exist somewhere on this install?".
