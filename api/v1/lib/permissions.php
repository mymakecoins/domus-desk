 * page (the checkbox matrix when creating/editing a key), and the docs page
 * (each endpoint states which permission it needs).
 *
 * A key's permissions are stored on api_keys.permissions as JSON:
 *   { "tickets": ["read","create"], "ticket_notes": ["read"] }
 * Anything not present is denied — keys start from zero.
