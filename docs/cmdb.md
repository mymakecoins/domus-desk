# CMDB Module — Design & Roadmap

Configuration Management Database. Models the IT estate as a graph of typed objects with a strict containment hierarchy and a separate lightweight relationships layer.

This document captures the design decisions made during planning so future work can continue without re-litigating them. Anything not listed here is undecided.

---

## Core concepts

**Class** — the *type* of thing. e.g. Server, SQL Instance, Database, Stored Procedure, SQL Job. Defined by an analyst in a settings UI.

**Object** — an *instance* of a class. e.g. an object with class `Database` and name `DOMUS_DESK`. Each object belongs to exactly one class.

**Property** — a named field on a class. All properties are user-defined per class. Property *types* include:
- Scalar values (text, number, date, boolean, dropdown)
- **Typed reference** — a property whose value is another object (e.g. a `Database` has an `Owner` property pointing at a `Person` object). 1:1 — a single linked object per property.

**Hierarchy (parent / child)** — strict tree. Each object has 0 or 1 parent and 0+ children. Parent semantics are **ontological dependency**: the parent is required for the child to exist. If you delete the parent, the children must go too (cascade delete).

Worked example:

```
Server (DBPROD01)
└── SQL Instance (MSSQLSERVER)
    └── Database (DOMUS_DESK)
        └── Stored Procedure (sp_archive_tickets)
            └── SQL Job (Nightly archive)
```

**Relationship** — a named, many-to-many link between any two objects. User-defined verbs (e.g. *depends on*, *connects to*, *managed by*, *replicates to*). This sits *alongside* the hierarchy, not inside it. The hierarchy answers "what owns this"; relationships answer everything else.

**Why split hierarchy from relationships?** A single graph with no distinction becomes a hairball within ~20 objects. Forcing every object into one parent gives you a navigable tree; keeping all the M:N links in their own table keeps the picture readable.

## UX principles

The point of a CMDB is to *tell you something useful*, not just to record data. Most CMDBs in the wild become write-only — analysts dutifully enter records, then nobody opens the module again because every screen shows fields instead of answers. The patterns below are the v1 antidotes.

### 1. Lead with synthesis, not fields

The top of every object detail page is a **2-3 sentence AI-generated summary** stating what this thing is, where it sits, who owns it, and what depends on it. Structured properties go below. The summary is what tells you something useful in 5 seconds; the fields are for when you need specifics. Example:

> *Production DOMUS_DESK database on MSSQLSERVER / DBPROD01, owned by IT Ops. 3 stored procedures and 2 SQL jobs depend on it, and it's referenced by 4 open tickets.*

Regenerated on demand (or cached and refreshed when properties/relationships change).

### 2. Impact panel, always visible

On every object: a panel showing what would be affected if this object were taken offline — its descendants in the hierarchy plus everything linked through inverse relationships. Pure graph traversal, no AI required for v1. (V2 layers a prose AI summary on top: *"Taking this offline would interrupt the nightly archive job and break the analyst dashboard's ticket counts widget."*)

### 3. Activity panel — cross-module visibility

On every object: open tickets touching this object, recent changes affecting it, related KB articles. This is what makes the CMDB feel woven into the rest of the product instead of inert.

### 4. Inline mini-graph

A small CSS-only visualisation on every object detail page showing parent above, this object centre, children below, related objects to the side. Gives a sense of place without leaving the page. Full force-directed graph viz is v2; this is the v1 stopgap.

### 5. Info card on every object reference

Anywhere the CMDB is mentioned elsewhere — in tickets, changes, search results, audit logs — render the reference as a card showing name + class + parent + owner, not just a text link. Context without clicking through.

### 6. Inline editing

Click a property value on the detail page to edit in place. No modal-per-edit friction. Save on blur or Enter.

### 7. Two browse modes

Tree view for navigating the hierarchy from a starting object; flat list view filtered by class for bulk inspection (sortable columns built from the class's properties). Same data, different lenses.

### 8. Empty states do work

When you create a new class, show AI-suggested properties inline (see V1 features). When you create your first object of a class, prompt for required fields with examples drawn from the class definition.

## V1 scope

### Data model (sketch — not final column types)

Every entity (classes, properties, objects, relationship types) gets an immutable auto-increment `id`. User-facing names and labels are editable freely; storage and references always go via the `id`. This is the safety net that makes renaming risk-free.

```
cmdb_classes
  id, class_key, name, description, icon, display_order, is_active
  -- class_key: immutable slug auto-generated from initial name; used by integrations
  --            and AI prompts. Editable only via a "rename key" advanced action.

cmdb_class_properties
  id, class_id, property_key, label, property_type,
  is_required, display_order
  -- property_key: immutable slug. Storage rows in cmdb_object_properties always
  --               reference id (not key), so even renaming the key is safe.
  -- label:        editable display name; renaming is free.
  -- property_type: text | number | date | boolean | dropdown | object_ref
  -- when object_ref: extra column referencing the target class_id

cmdb_class_property_options
  id, property_id, option_value, display_order
  -- only used by dropdown-type properties

cmdb_objects
  id, class_id, name, parent_id, created_datetime, updated_datetime
  -- parent_id is FK to cmdb_objects with ON DELETE CASCADE
  -- name is freely editable; integrations and references always use id.

cmdb_object_properties
  id, object_id, property_id, value_text, value_number,
  value_date, value_boolean, value_object_id
  -- only one value_* column populated per row, matching the property_type

cmdb_relationship_types
  id, verb, inverse_verb, description, is_active
  -- e.g. verb="depends on", inverse_verb="is depended on by"
  -- both verbs editable; cmdb_object_relationships stores the type id, not the verb.

cmdb_object_relationships
  id, from_object_id, to_object_id, relationship_type_id, created_datetime
```

AI settings are stored in the existing `system_settings` table under prefixed keys (`cmdb_ai_provider`, `cmdb_ai_api_key` (encrypted), `cmdb_ai_model`, `cmdb_ai_verify_ssl`) — same pattern as RFP AI / Knowledge AI / Forms AI / Reply Cleanup. No new settings tables needed.

### V1 features

**Settings page** with the following tabs (mirrors the layout of Tickets → Settings):
- **Classes** — CRUD for classes; shows class list with object counts
- **Properties** — managed inline on the Classes tab (per-class property editor)
- **Relationship types** — CRUD for verbs and inverse verbs
- **AI integration** — provider (Anthropic / OpenAI), API key (encrypted, masked), model dropdown, verify-SSL toggle, Test connection button. Separate key from RFP AI / Knowledge AI / Forms AI / Reply Cleanup so usage shows on its own line in the Anthropic billing console (matches the established per-feature key pattern). A Custom Instructions textarea is appended to the system prompt at runtime so analysts can shape AI output to their environment.

**Object management:**
- Objects CRUD with class picker, parent picker (must be a valid class — see open questions), and dynamic property form rendered from the class definition
- Inline editing on the object detail page (click a value, edit in place, save on blur)
- Required-property validation on save
- Relationships UI on each object's detail view — add/remove links with verb, grouped by direction (incoming / outgoing) and verb

**Browse and surface:**
- Object detail page laid out per the [UX principles](#ux-principles) above — AI summary header, quick facts row, properties, relationships, activity panel, impact panel, inline mini-graph
- Tree view: navigate the parent/child hierarchy from any object
- Flat list view per class: sortable, filterable table built dynamically from the class's property definitions
- Global search bar (text match against object names and key property values)
- **Info card** rendered everywhere a CMDB object is referenced (including from other modules in v2)

**V1 AI features** (all reusing the existing Anthropic streaming helper):
- **Object summary** at the top of every detail page — short prose synthesis of class, hierarchy, owner, and what depends on it
- **Suggest properties for this class** — when creating a new class (e.g. *Firewall*), the AI proposes 6-10 sensible properties with types. Analyst ticks the ones they want.
- **Suggest a relationship** — on the object detail view, an AI button scans the rest of the CMDB and proposes plausible relationships the analyst may have missed (e.g. "It looks like DOMUS_DESK might also depend on the *Auth Service* — add this relationship?")

### V1 explicit non-goals

These are **deliberately out** of v1 — see V2 below.

- **Class inheritance.** Classes are flat. Five separate classes for the SQL chain example, with their own duplicated common fields where necessary. Pain of duplication is small at the start; complexity of inheritance is significant.
- **Discovery / auto-sync** from external sources (vCenter, InTune, network scans). All v1 objects are entered manually.
- **Force-directed graph visualisation.** V1 ships only the inline mini-graph and the tree view; full D3-style dependency-graph viz is v2.
- **Versioning / change history** of object properties.
- **Permissions / RBAC** beyond the existing module-level access control.
- **Natural-language search and impact Q&A in prose.** V1 AI is targeted assistance (summarise, suggest); free-form chat is v2.

### Design decisions that shape v1 (and protect v2)

- **Human-readable vocabulary from day one.** Labels, relationship verbs, and class names should read like natural language — `"depends on"` not `"DEP"`, `Database Owner` not `DBO`. The v1 AI features feed these strings straight into the prompt; obscure abbreviations would force a glossary layer later. Flag this in the settings UI ("Use plain English — this is what AI features see").
- **Typed reference properties exist in v1.** Object-to-object property links mean the AI sees a rich graph from day one, not a thin one.
- **Cascade delete on parent_id.** Because parent semantics are ontological dependency, the FK enforces it. No orphan handling logic needed.
- **AI features are first-class in v1, not bolted on later.** Building the AI summary, property suggestions, and relationship suggestions into v1 means the data model and UI are designed *with* AI in mind from the first commit — the alternative is retrofitting prompts onto a UX that wasn't built to surface them.

---

## V2 additive improvements

Each of these can be added later without breaking v1 data or schema. Listed roughly by likely value.

### 1. Deeper AI features

V1 already ships object summaries, property suggestions, and relationship suggestions. V2 adds the larger, more open-ended features that need the v1 base data and AI plumbing in place first:

- **Free-form chat panel** on the CMDB module — natural-language search and exploration ("Show me servers Bob owns that haven't been edited in 6 months", "Which databases are missing a backup_schedule property?").
- **Impact analysis Q&A in prose** — "If I take DBPROD01 down for 2 hours tonight, what's the blast radius?" The LLM walks the hierarchy and relationships graph and answers in plain English, naming affected services, owners to notify, and tickets/changes potentially impacted. (V1 already shows the raw impact panel; v2 prose-summarises it.)
- **Stale-data nudges** — proactive suggestions on the dashboard when an object hasn't been edited in N months, or when a class has objects with required-but-missing fields.
- **Bulk import / classification** — paste or upload a CSV; the AI proposes a mapping into existing classes and properties (with new class suggestions where nothing fits).

**Non-breaking** — pure additive. No schema changes; reuses the v1 AI settings and key.

### 2. Class inheritance

Add an optional `parent_class_id` to `cmdb_classes`. A child class inherits all properties of its parent and can add its own. Object queries gain an "include subclasses" toggle.

Migration path: take a flat v1 class with many properties (e.g. `Server`) and split it into `Server` (common props) + `Physical Server` / `VM` / `Cloud Instance` (specific props). Existing objects get reassigned to the most appropriate child class.

**Non-breaking** — `parent_class_id` defaults to NULL (no inheritance), and existing flat classes work unchanged.

### 3. Discovery / sync feeds

Pipe data from existing modules into the CMDB:

- vCenter VMs become `VM` objects automatically
- InTune devices become `Endpoint` objects
- Asset records become `Hardware` objects

Each feed needs a class mapping and a "source of truth" rule (manual edits vs sync overwrite). Likely a `cmdb_object_sources` table tracking which external system owns which property values.

**Non-breaking** — sync layer adds rows to existing tables.

### 4. Visualisation

Dependency graph view — D3 or vis.js force-directed graph showing an object plus everything it relates to (hierarchy + relationships) within N hops. Click a node to navigate.

**Non-breaking** — read-only view over existing data.

### 5. Versioning / change history

Audit log of property changes per object, like the existing ticket audit pattern.

**Non-breaking** — new `cmdb_object_audit` table.

### 6. CMDB-aware features in other modules

- Tickets: link a ticket to an affected CMDB object; view "open tickets affecting this object" on the object detail page.
- Change Management: scope a change to one or more CMDB objects; impact analysis (v2 AI) shows what else might be affected.
- Knowledge: link a KB article to a class or object ("Runbook for DOMUS_DESK database").

**Non-breaking** — additive FKs in the consuming modules.

---

## Decisions locked

- **Immutable IDs everywhere.** Every entity (class, property, object, relationship type) has an immutable auto-increment `id`. All references — between rows, from other modules, from AI prompts — go via `id`. User-facing names and labels are freely editable.
- **Property key + label split.** `property_key` is an immutable slug auto-generated from the initial label; `label` is the editable display name. Same for `class_key` on classes.
- **No object-name uniqueness constraint.** Two databases can both be called `master` on different SQL instances. Can be tightened later if needed; relaxing the other way would require a dedup migration.
- **Relationships are symmetric via `inverse_verb`.** Creating "X depends on Y" auto-surfaces "Y is depended on by X" when viewing Y. No duplicate row needed.

## Open questions (cross when we come to them)

These can all be deferred to when they bite. None of them block starting v1.

1. **Parent picker scoping.** Should a child's parent be constrained to a specific class (a Database's parent must be a SQL Instance), or freeform? Adding the constraint later is additive (new `cmdb_class_allowed_parents` table). Risk of deferring: some users may build odd hierarchies that need cleanup later.

2. **Required-property defaults.** When marking an existing property `is_required`, what happens to existing objects that don't have a value? Block the change, prompt for a default, or leave them invalid until next edit? Pure UX decision, no schema impact.

3. **Module placement.** Top-level entry in the waffle menu (likely), sub-module under Asset Management, or standalone tab? Cosmetic — easy to move.
